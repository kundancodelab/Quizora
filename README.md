# SwiftQuizApp
SwiftQuiz is a fun and interactive quiz app developed using Swift for iOS. The app challenges users with a series of multiple-choice questions, where users must select the correct answer within a 30-second time limit. The quiz consists of four options for each question, and users must choose the right one before the time runs out. It's a perfect app for testing knowledge on various topics and improving decision-making under time pressure!
